# HeartDiseasePrediction

Preventing heart diseases is of utmost importance, and data-driven systems that can accurately predict heart diseases play a crucial role in research and prevention efforts. Machine Learning has emerged as a powerful tool in predicting heart diseases with high accuracy.

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of heart disease patients by employing various data processing techniques. The dataset is utilized to train and evaluate different Machine Learning models, including , Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (Linear) and Logistic Regression. The goal is to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using a range of input features.

The Jupyter Notebook code provided in this project showcases the implementation of these Machine Learning algorithms in Python. The dataset used for training and testing the models is included as well.

Machine Learning Algorithms Utilized:

Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)

Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)

Random Forest (Scikit-learn)

Support Vector Machine - Linear (Scikit-learn)

By leveraging these Machine Learning algorithms, accurate predictions can be made regarding the presence of heart disease. This project aims to contribute to the advancement of heart disease prediction models, ultimately improving the overall well-being and health of individuals.
